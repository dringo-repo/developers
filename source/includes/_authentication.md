# API Authentication

Dringo uses API key/secret pairs to generate temporary session tokens, allowing access to the API. If you are an organization admin, you can generate API key/secret pairs on your user settings page, under the "Account" tab.

## Generating a session token

> To generate a session token, use this code:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://example.dringo.io/api/sessions'
  -D '{
        "key": "xyz",
        "secret": "xyz"
      }'
```

> If successful, the above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "token": "abc",
  "expires_at": 1540662498
}
```

Before making API requests, session tokens can be generated by making a POST request to the `api/sessions` endpoint.

<aside class="notice">
These temporary session tokens will expire after 24 hours.

## Using a session token

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl 'api_endpoint_here'
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=meowmeowmeow'
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Dringo expects for the session token to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Token token=meowmeowmeow`
